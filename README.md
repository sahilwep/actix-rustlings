## Getting Started

To get started with Actix, make sure you have Rust installed on your system. You can install Rust by following the instructions on [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once Rust is installed, you can create a new Actix project by using Cargo, Rust's package manager:

```bash
$ cargo new my_actix_project
$ cd my_actix_project
```

Then, add Actix as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
actix-web = "4.5.1"
```

Now, you're ready to start building your Actix application!
